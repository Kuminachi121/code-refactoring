# Code-refactoring Homework

## Description

Horiseon is a company that specializes in optimizing search engines to reference your website over others. 

## What I changed

Used semantic HTML elements, structure independent of styling and positioning. Added discriptive alt tags to all images and icons. All heading attributes fall in sequential order. Gave the title element a concise and descriptive title.
